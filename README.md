Improved Blizzard UI (Battle for Azeroth Edition)
Clean & Immersive
====================

This is a fork of https://github.com/kaytotes/ImprovedBlizzardUI updated with some changes for my personal preference for a cleaner and more immersive expierence whilst still being highly functional, along with oversight fixes & added goodies. I do keep this updated as freq are required via mergeing as Kytotes pushes new changes which do not directly conflict.
## PLEASE DO NOT BUG KYTOTES WITH ANY ISSUE YOU FIND IN THIS FORK!!!
