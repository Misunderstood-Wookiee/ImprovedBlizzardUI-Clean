### Plus Edition? What gives.
As this suggests includes fixes for oversights & handles my personal gripes/desires. I do keep this updated as required via mergeing whenever Kytotes pushes fixes which do not directly conflict too maintain coherency between the original and this fork however due to Kaytots no longer providing support for BFA this version will likely be updated with better fixes, don't worry this version is still kept up-to date with the latest stability changes from Kytotos when they are made available. 

I also pull request any major fixes over to Kaytoes's original project though when or if he accepts those and pushes a new build to curse/twitch is out of my control.
